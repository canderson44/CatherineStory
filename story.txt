Once there was a man named Bob. Bob was an avid amateur entomologist. His favorite insect was the leaf cutter ant, but sadly he lived in Sweden, far away from the ant's natural habitat. He dreamed of traveling south to see them in person.

One day, Bob bought a lottery ticket from his local gas station. To his surprise, he won fifty million dollars from this lottery ticket. Bob was pretty gosh darn happy.

Bob used his fifty thousand dollars to fly back to Sweden and try to find some more leaf cutter ants. One day he ran across a whole colony of leaf cutters doing some leaf cutting. Bob took a great picture and framed it for his home.

Bob was perplexed by the situation. He couldn't figure out how those leaf cutter ants ended up there. At the same time, he felt blessed to have his favorite insects around. "I flew by half the Earth to find you, but you're here all the time" he said.

Bob used some more of his lottery money to publish a book about the Swedish leaf cutter ants. He even got to name the species, since he discovered it! From then on every weekend Bob would drive the handful of miles over to the ant colonies to visit his ants. He was so happy he bought that lottery ticket!

The End.
