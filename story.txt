Once there was a man named Bob. Bob was an avid amateur entomologist. His favorite insect was the leaf cutter ant, but sadly he lived in Sweden, far away from the ant's natural habitat. He dreamed of traveling south to see them in person.

One day, Bob bought a lottery ticket from his local gas station. To his surprise, he won fifty million dollars from this lottery ticket. Bob was pretty gosh darn happy.
